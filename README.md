# Companion

Companion's goal is to aid ruby developers by detailing the insides of their ruby program in line with where they're currently at in their editor. For example, if a developer had `foo.rb` open and was at the `def bar` method, companion woud show the results of that methods and other relevant information (current variables set, etc.).

## Status

Companion is currently in development and likely isn't useful yet.

## Try it out

1. Clone the git repo: git `clone git@github.com:seanlerner/companion.git`
2. Change into the companion directory `cd companion`
3. Run companion and monitor the test ruby script `bin/companion test_area/test.rb`
4. Modify the `test_area/test.rb` file, save it, and the companion screen will update with new information (note that this isn't fully working properly yet)
